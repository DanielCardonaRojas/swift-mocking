/// A ``Stub`` is a type that provides a pre-canned answer for a single method.
///
/// You use stubs to control the behavior of a dependency during a test. For example, you can stub a method to return a specific value, or to throw an error.
/// Stubs are created by calling the `when(calledWith:)` method on a ``Spy`` and are recorded to intercept invocations on a method and
/// return the programmed return value.
public class Stub<each I, Effects: Effect, O> {
    /// The ``InvocationMatcher`` that defines when this stub should be applied.
    public let invocationMatcher: InvocationMatcher<repeat each I>
    var output: ((Invocation<repeat each I>) -> Return<O>)?

    /// Initializes a `Stub` instance.
    /// - Parameter invocationMatcher: The ``InvocationMatcher`` that determines when this stub is active.
    init( invocationMatcher: InvocationMatcher<repeat each I>) {
        self.invocationMatcher = invocationMatcher
    }

    func returnValue(for invocation: Invocation<repeat each I>) -> Return<O>? {
        guard invocationMatcher.isMatchedBy(invocation) else {
            return nil
        }

    /// Defines a dynamic return value using a closure that receives the method arguments.
    ///
    /// This allows you to create stubs with behavior that depends on the actual
    /// arguments passed to the method. The closure receives the same arguments
    /// as the original method and can compute a return value based on them.
    ///
    /// Example:
    /// ```swift
    /// when(mock.calculate(a: .any, b: .any)).thenReturn { a, b in
    ///     return a + b  // Dynamic calculation based on arguments
    /// }
    /// ```

    /// Defines a dynamic return value using a closure that receives the method arguments.
    ///
    /// This is an alias for `thenReturn(_:)` that provides a more concise syntax
    /// for dynamic stubbing scenarios.
    ///
    /// Example:
    /// ```swift
    /// when(mock.calculate(a: .any, b: .any)).then { a, b in
    ///     return a * b  // Dynamic calculation
    /// }
